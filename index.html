    <p>
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Our tests of screenreader and voice helper
      were used on the operating system MacOS. We both tested on the Google
      Chrome Browser using MacOS 13.0.1.

    <h2>Sites with Screenreader</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
      </li>
      <p>
        Youtube was very simple to navigate from video to video using the tab
        and shift tab shortcuts. Clicking into the videos was simple as the
        shortcut that was only neccessary was hitting the enter button.
      </p>
      <li>
        <a href="">ESPN</a>
      </li>
      <p>
        ESPN was a horrible experience because it didn't follow a good path to
        be able to tab from link to link. If you wanted to skip over from one
        link to another it would take an extra short cut to find what you were
        looking for. Infortmation was too cluttered and heavy to find.

    <h2>First time using Talkback</h2>

    <p>
      It's hard to understand how to do anything at first. Even with being able
      to look at the screen it still brought difficulty being able to navigate
      with Screenreader turned on. When voice is turned on, it will
      automatically cycle through the links and read them out to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Screenreader without vision</h2>

    <p>
      The biggest difficulty that came with not being able to see was being able
      to find exactly where all of the keys were on the keyboard. Not knowing
      where everything was made it difficult to be able to do the short cut
      keys. While it's talking to you, it makes it difficult to focus on
      anything other than the loud voice being played through to your ear.
      Surrounding information become obsolute.
